    Thank you for registering for Kuberoke! You have now been added to the guest list.

    When a slot becomes available, we will send out a QR code which will let you enter the venue.

    NOTE: WE WILL ONLY ADMIT PEOPLE WITH A QR CODE. We will not admit friends who tag along with
    someone with a code, or someone who has registered but not received their code. Space at the venue
    is limited and we thank you for respecting your fellow attendees and the volunteers working the event.

    Once you have received your QR code, you have a limited amount of time to arrive.

    If you're late and the venue is full, you can queue at the door or come back at a later time.
    We will fill the venue from the queue first, before sending out new QR codes.

    If the venue is not full and you have a valid QR code, you can enter even if you're late.

    See you soon at Kuberoke!
