    Thank you for registering for Kuberoke! You have now been added to the guest list.

    When a slot becomes available, we will send out a QR code which will let you enter the venue.

    Once you have received your QR code, you have a limited amount of time to arrive.

    If you're late and the venue is full, you can queue at the door or come back at a later time.
    We will fill the venue from the queue first, before sending out new QR codes.

    If the venue is not full and you have a valid QR code, you can enter even if you're late.

    See you soon at Kuberoke!
